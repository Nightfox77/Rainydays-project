A Website for durable outdoor jackets

## Description

The Rainydays project is one of the first projects I made. I frequently come back to implement changes and new features. 
It started just as a hardcoded website but as I progressed in my studies things got more interactive and dynamic.
- the content/images are called from a RestAPI I made with WordPress
- depending on what site the user is on only certain products are shown
- the shopping cart has a validation flow that unlocks the next step when all requirements are fulfilled
- the details and contact pages also have their validation processes before the button is enabled
   

## Built With

- Html
- CSS
- JS
- WordPress
- RestAPI

## Things I`d like to add later

- I want to add functionality to the search bar. Showing results depending on the word entered.
- A comment section on the details page
- Send data from the contact form to WordPress
-
